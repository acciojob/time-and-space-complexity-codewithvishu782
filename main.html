	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of computational time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of its input size. It is crucial for evaluating how <em>efficient</em> an algorithm is in solving a problem, especially for large datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input data. It is typically expressed using notations such as <em>O(n)</em>, which represents the upper bound of memory requirements for an algorithm.
